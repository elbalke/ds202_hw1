```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    **Answer:** Done

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    **Answer:** Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    **Answer:** 
    
    **Elisabeth Balke** *Advertising*
    
    I am a 3rd year Senior (which makes me a young'un!) and I am exctited to hone my skill in data visualizaitons in this course. When I'm not at school, I get to enjoy working at a photography studio on Main Street in Ames & also working for Washington Media Scholars as an intern, both part time. When I'm not at work or at school, you can find me hanging out at Salt Company, with new friends I've made, cooking, or playing some new song I just found on guitar.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    **Answer:** Media research assistants
    
    Research assistants for media planning and buying firms take in a lot of information to choose efficent media buys in political and consumer advertising. I had experience doing this as the data intern with [National Media](https://natmedia.com/#process) (a research, planning, & placement political ad firm) over this summer. Using data science methods to analyze hundreds of thousands of voter files, and billions of dollars in political ad placements speeds up the process of evaluation considerably.

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.


    **Answer:** I'll be highly interested in political data, this year especially with 2020 elections. 
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    **Answer:** ``` > `version` ```
                                        
platform       x86_64-w64-mingw32          
arch           x86_64                      
os             mingw32                     
system         x86_64, mingw32             
status                                     
major          4                           
minor          0.2                         
year           2020                        
month          06                          
day            22                          
svn rev        78730                       
language       R                           
version.string R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)
nickname       Taking Off Again 
    
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    **Answer:** Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    **Answer:** ```
    git version 2.28.0.windows.1
    ```
    
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    **Answer:** Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?

    **Answer:** elbalke
